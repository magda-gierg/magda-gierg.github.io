        Experience without judging or reacting.<br>
        Whatever it is that you are experiencing, just experience it. Do not judge it to be good or bad. If it is possible, try not to react to it. If you have to react try to take five breaths before reacting. The more we are able to create space between stimulus and reaction, the more control we will have over our emotional lives.
