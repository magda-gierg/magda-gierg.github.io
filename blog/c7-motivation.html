      <p>Tony Hsieh describes three types of happiness: pleasure, passion, and higher purpose.</br>
      <p>Pleasure: this type of happiness is about always chasing the next high. It is the rock-star type of happiness because it is very hard to maintain unless you are living the lifestyle of a rock star.</br> Passion: also known as “flow,” where peak performance meets peak engagement, and time flies by.</br>
Higher Purpose: this is about being part of something bigger than yourself that has meaning to you.</p>
<h5>"the best way to find motivation at work is to find our own higher purpose. If we know what we value most and what is most meaningful to us, then we know what we can work on that serves our higher purpose. When that happens, our work can become a source of sustainable happiness for us. We can then become very good at our work because we are happy doing it, which in turn allows us to enjoy the happiness of flow with increasing frequency".</h5>
<p> My values are: honesty, kindness, reliability, positive-attitude.</br>
  I stand for: freedom, equality, integrity, empathy and tolerance. </p>

  <h4><span class="letter_color">O</span>ptimism is something that can be learned!</h4>
</div>
  <p> I've found the resilience ideas very interesting, specialy cognitive resilience -> 'understanding how we explain our setbacks to ourselves and creating useful mental habits help us develop optimism'.</p>
