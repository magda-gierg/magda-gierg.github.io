  Please don't make the background pink... have a little pity on your teachers!

There are three key components to mindful conversation: listening, looping, and dipping. Listening means giving the gift of attention to the speaker. Looping means closing the loop of communication by demonstrating that you have really heard what the person is saying. Dipping means checking in with yourself, knowing how you are feeling about what you are hearing.
</br>From  my mindfulness conversation I have learn that we have to give a lot of attention to the speaker and be sure that we fully understood the speaker.

        To sustain my practice I will take one breath a day.
