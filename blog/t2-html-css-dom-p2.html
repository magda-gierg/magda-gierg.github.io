      Responsiveness - changing the size of the page to fit. <br>
      We use many diffrent devices to access the Internet and this devices (e.g.laptops, tablets, phones) uses a diffrent size screen (resolution) to show us the same content. The responsive design means that our website is not fixed with single size. It does not matter the type of device. The page is going to respond and resize corectlly to make sure everything looks ok. and is legible.
