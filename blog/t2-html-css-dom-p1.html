    <p>
      Website is like your house. HTML files are like a structure where the wall's placed. CSS files are then the style of your house.
    </p>
    <p>
     All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
  <br> Everything on the webpage is a box and by thinking in this way we can actually rearrange things very easily.
