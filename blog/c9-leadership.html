      <h2>Compassionate Leadership Is the Most Effective Leadership</h2>
      <h3>"This shift is the transformation from “I” to “We.” It is the most important process leaders go through in becoming authentic. How else can they unleash the power of their organizations unless they motivate people to reach their full potential? If our supporters are merely following our lead, then their efforts are limited to our vision and our directions.... Only when leaders stop focusing on their personal ego needs are they able to develop other leaders".</h3>
      <p>I've worked both with compassionate and not compassionate leaders and I prefer to work witk those compassionate ones. </p>
      <p>I've tried multiplying goodness meditation and Tonglen meditation and I've found them very interesting and useful.</p>
      <p>I think that listening with an open mind helps handling the difficult conversation.</p>
