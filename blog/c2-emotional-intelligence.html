    <p>
      The emotional intelligence is one of the best predictors of success at work and fulfillment in life, and it is trainable for everyone.
      <br>Emotional Intelligence refers to the ability to monitor one’s own and other’s feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions.

     The two minutes of mindfulness - I find it as a good practise. We can quietly enjoy then our being.
     <br>The mindfulness means "paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally."
