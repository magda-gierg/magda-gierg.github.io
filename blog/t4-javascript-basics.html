      <p>The three main technologies used to create web pages (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) each do different special jobs.</p>
      <p>
        HTML - marks the content up into different structural types, like paragraphs, blocks, lists, images, tables, forms, comments etc.
      </p>
      <p>  CSS - tells the browser how each type of element should be displayed, which may vary for different media (like screen, print or handheld device)
      </p>
      <p>JavaScript - tells the browser how to change the web page in response to events that happen (like clicking on something, or changing the value in a form input)
      </p>
      <p>
        In programming, making decisions with code is called control flow. Control flow statements enable JavaScript to make decisions by executing different code based on a condition. <em>A real life example of this sort of "decision-making" could be: "If the traffic light is green, keep moving; if yellow, then wait; if red, then stop".</em>
      </br>
      <p>Loops let us tell the computer to loop over a block of code so that we don't have to write out the same process over and over. <em>The sequence of day and night work in an infinite loop.</em>
      </p>
      <p>Arrays are JavaScript's way of making lists. These lists can store different data types and they are ordered, meaning the position of each list item is numbered by JavaScript. We can access an item using its number, just like we would in an ordinary list.
      </br>
      Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through  properties.There are two ways to access the properties of an object: the dot operator (.) and bracket notation ([]).
    </p>
    <p>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
    </br>Why functions? You can reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times. You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
