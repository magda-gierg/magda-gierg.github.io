    <p>
      The most important is my attitiude. Attitude to the boodcamp, to other people working with me. The consciounes that we are in it together. The confidence that I can really do it, the sense that it is my experience and I will do it amazing for myself.
    </p>

      I am really looking forward to kea 2017 boodcamp! I am curious how it will go.

      I am excited that I will be a part of this learning enviroment. Maybe I am a bit nervous as well, like always before something new is going to happend.
