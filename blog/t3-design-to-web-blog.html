  Notice that we have three stylesheet links: the first two are for the Skeleton framework,
  and the final one is for any custom styles we might need, like turning the background
  bright pink.

  Please don't make the background pink... have a little pity on your teachers!

        Responsive websites respond to the size of the browser at any given point. No matter what the browser width may be, the site adjusts its layout in a way that is optimized to the screen.

        Mobile-first forces us to focus on core content and functionality. It is an approach to responsive design: design for smaller screens first, then add more features and content for bigger and bigger screens.

      Framework is a real or conceptual structure intended to serve as a support or guide for the building of something that expands the structure into something useful.

            <p>
      Wireframing is a way to design a website service at the structural level. A wireframe is commonly used to lay out content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys. Wireframes are used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added.
