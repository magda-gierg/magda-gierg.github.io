    <p>
      Responsive websites respond to the size of the browser at any given point. No matter what the browser width may be, the site adjusts its layout in a way that is optimized to the screen.

      Mobile-first forces us to focus on core content and functionality. It is an approach to responsive design: design for smaller screens first, then add more features and content for bigger and bigger screens.

    Framework is a real or conceptual structure intended to serve as a support or guide for the building of something that expands the structure into something useful.

    Wireframing is a way to design a website service at the structural level. A wireframe is commonly used to lay out content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys. Wireframes are used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added.
