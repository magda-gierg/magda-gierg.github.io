  Please don't make the background pink... have a little pity on your teachers!

        Responsive websites respond to the size of the browser at any given point. No matter what the browser width may be, the site adjusts its layout in a way that is optimized to the screen.

      <p>
        Mobile-first forces us to focus on core content and functionality. It is an approach to responsive design: design for smaller screens first, then add more features and content for bigger and bigger screens.

      Framework is a real or conceptual structure intended to serve as a support or guide for the building of something that expands the structure into something useful.There are two types of frameworks - backend and frontend. Backend frameworks deal with the logis and server-side. Frontend frameworks usually consist of a package made up of a structure of files and folders of standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS documents etc.)

              Wireframing is a way to design a website service at the structural level. A wireframe is commonly used to lay out content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys. Wireframes are used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added.
